<h1>Random Quote Machine</h1>
<p>This project is my solution for Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front End Development Project called Build a Random Quote Machine. The goal of the exercise is to show a new randomly selected quote after pressing a button and to tweet out the quote with pressing another button. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to complete it.</p>
